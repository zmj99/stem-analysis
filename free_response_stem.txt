Not sure. Maybe the STEM majors care less about politics.
Most stem majors are now interested in politics and if anything view it as a barrier to rational action 
Idk
They may not feel it is important to them or they didn't have time and blew it off.
We‚Äôre focused on school, not really outside of it
Have more things they need to be doing instead.
Less interest in the major media pushed issues 
I think that people in STEM are just more focused on coursework and involvements in school than what is happening around them. 
STEM majors are more technically minded while other majors are more emotionally minded
We have other work to be doing 
Difficult coursework and emphasis on major related clubs and activities lead to a smaller knowledge of political events and lower education on voting topics as a whole.
People aren't as concerned with social matters and politics.


Not sure, seems dumb 
I don't know 
20%
STEM majors are busy working on homework, studies, and research 
Not sure
I don‚Äôt know
Many are from other countries and cannot vote.

I feel politics does not affect STEM studies as much as it may liberal arts or other areas of studies, so they may not think about politics as often as other majors do.
Lack of time and interest to understand Important issues
Apathy, I am of the opinion that how I interact with the society around me is more important than what I think about some individual who I don't know personally who thinks that they are qualified to set policies and shape society from a position that is sort of removed from it.
They don‚Äôt know enough about it
Studying for STEM is stressful enough as it is, and politics add more stress. Also, politics are not interesting.
I believe that we are more focused on school or science related issues rather than what is happening in our government. 
Presidential Candidates usually don't consider science when implementing acts
Not sure
Generalizing, stem majors may align with a third-party candidate (ie libertarian) or object to voting because they do not see either major candidate as favorable.
They‚Äôre not interested 
anxiety 
STEM majors are historically hard majors, and are likely more focused on their classes than their non-STEM counterparts.
Because they dint want to

We have presumably more important things to do, whereas in reality that is not true
Course loads make it difficult to stay informed
Less interested in politics
Focused more on current major than politics, higher stress, and complacency. I feel like voting has a factor of stress involved in it, such the fact that smart voters like to educate themselves on the politics of whom and where they‚Äôre voting before making a decision. I feel as if maybe some voters just pick someone without full perspective on who/what they‚Äôre voting for.
Just a lack of civic interest 
Maybe the people in these majors tend to look at voting in a more mathematical way, and see themselves as insignificant. I also think the people in these majors have a (somewhat true) stereotype of being introverted, so would prefer not to go vote, but that seems far fetched.
Maybe they didn't care enough to vote
More time consuming majors, less likely to be politically involved in general
Politics don't matter because it's a popularity contest.
well it's only 10% lower, I'd say that's significant but not alarming. Perhaps us STEM majors are too busy studying to worry about local politics.
Time
Class schedules made it difficult for me to educate myself in candidates, and I thought an uneducated vote was worse than no vote. Also, I could not get to any polling place between classes due to transportation concerns. I imagine many of my peers felt the same way. 
We don‚Äôt have the time with our studies to go stand in lines to vote so we only vote in the general election because that seems most important 

The workload is very high, so STEM majors tend to stay in 
Being in the STEM major I‚Äôve noticed many students just not interested in politics.
Many are somewhat apolitical
Don't pay attention, lack of info on dates and locations for voting
Because people don‚Äôt care
Nobody cares
Some stem majors probably just don‚Äôt care 

We just got too much other stuff like homework and labs to worry about. Also our math brains know that one vote is useless on grand scheme of things.  
Apathy towards politics
There are no political ties in the classes we take. Other than things like defense and military, politics rarely ever comes up in the subjects we study every day, unlike business, political science, sociology, etc. If politics were mentioned every day/week in my classes, it would probably be likely that more STEM vote
a lot of stem people dont like to discuss politics for some reason
Generally, STEM majors are quieter and tend to keep their heads down. They don‚Äôt generally try to make statements in politics and are far more concerned about new tech, games, coding, etc.
Maybe people are too busy to vote. 
STEM majors generally aren't as politically active because it is not usually in their interest.
Younger people in general don't vote at high percentages.
More focused on class 
They are probably busier than most other majors. Also, so long as we speak of voting as a ‚Äúcivic duty‚Äù,  STEM students who tend to pride themselves on being strictly rational will have no interest in participating in something for such a meaningless reason. I think if we want more STEM students to vote we have to talk more about the objective value of an individual vote, when we take into account the total impact the candidates have on everyone (not just the individual voter) and divide that by the chance that a single vote affects the election‚Äôs outcome 
Time constraints 
Lack of discussion and time
Lack of time.
They are very busy with a lot of technical classes.

Apathy
I feel that most Stem people don't care for politics and have other more important things on their mind.. Statistically speaking, Stem majors are more intelligent than most other majors and don't like the constant debates and annoyance of people who hate others just for political views. Also, the general election, is decided by the electoral college; not by individual voters. 
Until recently stem interested students probably haven‚Äôt been affected by politics. I would assume now with how important stem is growing world wide, the decisions made in Washington will be affecting us much more. Hopefully that brings the voting rate up.
These Technical majors have many students from other countries who may not be eligible to vote in the United States
People who choose to major in STEM fields tend to be less interested in humanities, which have a much stronger connection to politics.
Politics are very subjective while engineers work with objective facts
Perhaps students don't have enough time to research issues, and aren't informed on the matters, leading them to feel that they aren't informed enough to make a thoughtful decision, so they just don't vote.
High enough IQ to realize that it's all a sham
Part of it could be the increased workload compared to many other degrees and part of it could be culture.
Antisocial/ isolative tendencies
Unsure

Changes with regard to most policies effect STEM careers to a lesser extent than others.

Unmotivated to vote
There's more STEM majors than CS, Engineering, and Math- namely Biology and Agriculture related majors

They are more disconnected from the political environment other than funding.
Busier/focus in coursework is different- our brains aren‚Äôt thinking of it as much as a priority 
Don‚Äôt make it a priority to vote and that the likely candidate to win has enough votes that you don‚Äôt need to go and vote.
We are more grounded in reality than other idealistic majors and understand our vote has little impact. Also don't care much for idealistic political arguments when it is unlikely any large changes will come anyway.
Not knowledgeable 
Too time-consuming of a process to talk about politics when the task at hand is more important.

"Politics isn't something that is discussed as much in science because science generally lays outside the fluctuations brought about by political change; plants will always need to be grown, roads will need to be build, animals and people will get sick and need to be healed. Also, STEM majors generally have ""heavier"" curriculum compared to, say, a communications major (no shade). I think STEM students tend to focus on their studies more than the outside world as a result."
Maybe because the political science major increase the University statistic?
I think that they are so busy voting gets pushed to the back burner
They don‚Äôt care
Politicians don‚Äôt represent stem majors well 
Not having an opinion 
Focus on academics - often not many classes relevant to current events in order to know how important their votes are. 
People feel they are not educated enough to vote
I believe is because we are busy all the time. Our majors require a lot from us and especially if you want to continue your education after your undergrad. Most STEM careers require you to be above and beyond with everything you do. So trying to choose someone for president is another big thing that is in the back of our mind. 
I think STEM majors are busy with work/school and do not have the time to look into candidates, and therefore do not want to vote uninformed.
We view other things as more important. Not involved in politics so the vote wouldn‚Äôt be educated
lack of caring, no emphasis on politics or social expectations in these majors
We don‚Äôt talk about it really in our classes, and I always have so much homework and so much to study for that politics kind of gets put on a back burner 



Not enough time
STEM students have to much to think about, for example Calc hwk. 

I think at least one thing that contributes to the low voting rate is the amount of out-of-state students we have. I think they either forget about or don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of absentee voting, causing numbers to be lower
Lower average interest in social issues

Little time 
We are too busy

Not caring
Less interest
Compared to liberal arts majors STEM are still mostly white males and I think they assume whatever candidate they want to win will win without them voting. Or they just don't care.
idk
Not as interested in politics or social issues
Busy and don‚Äôt care
They don't see a reason to be interested since science tends to not be involved in politics.

I think that politicians pull on a lot of emotional strings and STEM majors tend to be more statistically based so we‚Äôre not as likely to believe something until we see the statistics. 
I would say as a STEM major it is hard to find time to go to the polling place. It is also difficult to stay educated on the matter as we are so focused in our studies/research/etc.a
Less contact with more humanities classes, political ideas, etc.
Their topics of interest aren't a big concern in politics 

They don't have as much open available time because I know how much work, classes, and homework they have to work on outside of classes
They are probably too busy studying their asses off for hard classes.
Lack of time 

they are busy
People dont see a reprecentitive that they identify politically with
Busy with coursework
idk
I think that STEM majors may view voting as an activity that is not truly worth their time and effort.
Voting happens at a part of the semester where a lot of studying occurs.
They are not as engaged socially. 
People do not see the importance. They may feel it does not matter. 
Lots of foreigners 

They‚Äôre busy with school so they just don‚Äôt take the time to go vote
They‚Äôre busy
Not sure.

We're more concerned with research and academics. 
zero free time
I think there are various reasons but I think most stem majors tend to think analytically and less on feelings or who they would seek out for an election. 
STEM majors are typically more busy with schoolwork than peers majoring in the humanities. It's highly likely these students lack the time and energy to make any significant investment in the voting process. 
They are too busy to be informed (watch news, etc.) and therefore do not feel educated enough on the topic to vote. Or just don't care.
they are busier (diff work hours)
They don't view voting as important because the results likely won't affect them and their chosen career path.
STEM majors deal in hard sciences which in my brain correlated to lack of interest in the politics of voting. 

we have less time to research candidates because of our course load and we are often busy during candidate events
They do not make an effort to be engaged in civil issues

Maybe a lot of STEM majors aren‚Äôt eligible because of age or are exchange students 
We don‚Äôt have time
Because we feel like it doesn‚Äôt really pertain to us or we‚Äôre not interested in politics
Classes may not emphasize the importance of social engagement
Many of the issues STEM majors care about are not as widely debated as other issues. For the most part science is generally accepted so debating it is dofficult
No idea
Because it is easy to get caught up with schoolwork and other employment, sometimes you can't find the time.
it‚Äôs hard to follow politics when your busy with school
Too busy

They do not put as much value in social/civic relations as students in other majors
They probably say they don‚Äôt have time to vote 
Politicians shove themselves down your throat with their ads and presence on campus. It pisses everyone off, and leaves all candidates in a bad light. this makes any voter who isn‚Äôt passionate about politics irritated and unwilling to go out of their way to support a candidate that pissed them off. 
Too busy doing homework to go vote
Intelligent people tend not to get involved in matters they believe are out of their hands, and we already know the voting system is flawed.
Not knowing how to register to vote
high libertarian density 
More students that are unable to vote 

Lack of care or interest, no knowledge on candidates
Voting is probably encouraged more in liberal arts classes as opposed to STEM classes because it‚Äôs less relevant to STEM topics of study. 

STEM field won't change much because of how important science is.
No clue 
They probably are not as concerned with the political side of things because they probably do not consider it as important to their interests or for their future jobs (most will probably get well off jobs). Life sciences most likely disagree (for as a BIO and ENSCI major, I am deeply concerned about the well-being of our earth while other STEM majors might not feel the same.
Focusing on classes and not talked about with peers.
Maybe potential stem voters don't think their vote will matter
Over analyze the candidates so there‚Äôs not a good kne
I‚Äôm unsure
STEM majors' course-load is prioritized over researching candidates, registering to vote, commuting to voting place, and standing in line to vote.
Maybe they're busy with schoolwork and don't have time to vote
I have no clue

I think that it has to do with the fact that we are trained to always second guess information and need to know a signifigant amount before forming an opinion. If poeple feel like they are not educated enough then they do not want to make an uninformed decision.
Less exposure to social issues/content (versus liberal arts learning content)
Busy.
People don‚Äôt believe that their vote matters etc 
We have homework to do
People are busy, lots of people not from iowa (voting is more difficult)
They aren‚Äôt as interested in politics. Politics are mainly drama and most STEM majors like facts and not lies and debates. 
Other majors probably talk about politics more
they might not think their one vote matters out of the whole population?
Because they have other things that are more important in their lives, can't say the same about liberal arts majors.
We are more foused on our classes and don't typically have a lot of free time compared to other majors
People in STEM majors likely aren't very interested in social sciences, including politics.
Lack of interest in politics. Limited accessibility to polling locations. 
Busy scheduling combined with a lack of interest in politics. Many have not developed their own political views 
A lot of STEM majors just focus on school and not on politics so they don‚Äôt want to vote if they are misinformed 
Unsure
Politicians are stupid, need more candidates like Andrew Yang
Too stressed out to vote, don't deal with things socially/only numbers and calculations, most don't see their vote as making an impact
STEM majors seem to have people that are very involved and dedicated to their course work so many don't take the time to go vote or involve themselves in the political field because they don't want to dedicate that time.
We have more important work to get done.

People may not care or see the importance of voting.
Curriculum doesn‚Äôt focus as heavily on political or societal issues
They don't care or don't see any impact one way or the other
Because they don't/can't find time in their schedules to take the time to vote. They also don't tend to pay close attention to the details of elections and would not be prepared to do so. 
There are better things to focus on
I think you should compare stem majors to the university wide percentage excluding outliers, I would expect poli sci majors to vote at a high rate near 100% and could not give an idea why stem majors are lower than the average unless I had a good understanding of the components of the ‚Äúuniversity wide‚Äù comparison. 
They don't care about politics
Distaste for monotonous political feuding of current political climate
They are not as educated in their classes about current events and politics, as opposed to other majors (those in LAS for example), that hear about current events more often in their classes. 
We don't have the time to step away on election day, we have to focus on studies.
Don't take the time to get educated on candidates.

There may not be a interest in voting with STEM majors. Also due to many reasons they may not feel there vote truly matters.
Stem majors don‚Äôt give a shit about politics
we're really busy
Nobody cares that much
Not enough time or just not enough interest. Generally stem majors make a good amount of money so with that comes some privilege and no desire to vote because it won‚Äôt effect them. 
Might not have as much time to invest in looking into candidates, platforms etc. 
Sometimes our egos get the better of us and we might see voting as something ‚Äúbeneath‚Äù us

It‚Äôs just not a priority I guess
Because as engineers, most political is extremely stupid to us. We deal with problems that have solutions and logical explanations to them. Politics is so full of scheming, lies, and false information it annoys us too much to try and keep up. We‚Äôre also extremely busy like god damn.  

I'm guessing a lot of people don't know how to change their voting address to ISU so they are eligible. And I'm guessing a lot of people are busy and think it is going to take a really long time.
They are conent with the present polictcal powers
Apathetic
they are busy?
They are less opinionated about certain things and do not like engaging in debates about political topics.
Lack of interest in politics
More time spent on schoolwork means lower amount of time to get informed about candidates 
I think stem majors generally just find less interest in political issues and don‚Äôt devote enough time to educating themselves adequately enough to make an educated vote.
They realize both parties are corrupt and power hungry. The two party system is just trying to pick the lesser of two evils. 
We do not learn about anything political in our classes and also often times tend to have more difficult majors so we are busy and don't find time to educate ourselves on politics. We have enough that we are trying to learn already and our brains can only hold so much
STEM majors tend to have a larger time requirement needed to complete their coursework
More rigorous coursework and less time to vote
Many STEM majors are uninterested in politics. 
They are to focus on school to care.
they care more about the sciences than politics, especially with how PC politics became

In general, I feel that people do not vote because they either feel that their vote does not matter or that they feel that they don't know connect with the candidates in the field because of a lack of knowledge. Many people today have smartphones, so they feel that the world's information is at their fingertips with just a click, but choose not explore it as it might not seem appetizing to them.
course load, low impact of one vote

 STEM majors lean more towards the individual freedom ideals and are libertarian at a higher rate. Stem majors can think and realize an individual vote will not actually make any change to the current corrupt system. 
We‚Äôre too busy studying and solving actual problems 
I believe that there is not a strong push from many of your peers to go vote because they are not as passionate about politics as there are no right answers in politics. I also feel that STEM majors feel that their voice will not matter because the impact of one vote will not make or break things.
"I think there is a culture that is prevalent within those majors that is hesitant to have a multifaceted personality. ""You can tell they don't really care about (stem subject) because they are so political""  "
STEAM Majors do not get involved in politics as much because it doesn‚Äôt matter 
STEM majors are busier than other majors
They have other things to focus on, so voting is very low on their priorities.
They try to avoid getting bogged down by opinions.
Less care about politics
They probably just don't care as much. 

Not having the time available due to class or homework
Less concerned with politics, too busy to think about it maybe

Maybe they just don‚Äôt care?
Possibly less social than other majors
Partially because the area of interest and of study is more removed from the political realm than other majors (like those in the humanities and social sciences tend to be).  It also may be because the STEM majors can tend to have difficult workloads so that there is not enough time to stay informed on political matters (especially since the class subject material often fails to even bring political topics into the students' consciousness).
Most of us are more focused on research or work. Most of us are liberal, liberals traditionally have lower voting rate.

STEM majors don't care

Not sure, might not be busy with other things. I'm not sure the correlation is necessarily causation in this case

Apathy
I don't think many of us are able to see how policies impact our lives. At least for me, I don't really care about U.S. policy because it doesn't really effect me. However, in the upcoming election I do have some opinions about things and will be voting for the first time.
Busy with classwork 
In terms of numbers the vote of one person doesn't matter
I‚Äôve never really seen STEM majors as people closely tied to being politically active, however it is something important that will hopefully change
Are you accounting for the number of foreign students ineligible to vote? I suppose if you are, then perhaps STEM majors are smart enough to see how rigged the system is in favor of elites and party establishments on both sides.
Could be that they're too preoccupied with their heavy course load 
They are less connected to the political scene

I wish I knew
low interest
There's so much for us to do, it doesn't feel like there's any time to go out and vote
No interest in politics 
Too focused on other things, don‚Äôt see how politics affects them
We are extremely busy.
STEM students are busiest during the voting time.

Apathy in STEM towards non-STEM topics

Low interest, probably less politically active, or disagree with more candidates 
Don't have time
Busy schedules, there‚Äôs always so much going on it‚Äôs hard to make time for things not ‚Äúrequired‚Äù. Also because of general interests, most of us don‚Äôt talk about politics a lot
STEM majors come into less contact with politically extreme indoctrination than in Liberal Arts classes. It is not life or death for most of us.
Less global interest 
We don't follow politics closely because A. its kinda depressing and B. I feel uninformed about how a lot of the plans candidates are laying out will actually work, and some people would rather not vote than make an uniformed vote and C. I would guess that STEM majors have more transfer students from out of country who aren't invested in US politics
I'm not sure, but I think one contributing factor is that we take a lot less political science/journalism courses, which keep people engaged with the news. STEM majors aren't really engaged because they have to go a lot more out of their way to get their news.
Disinterest and corruption in politics
ü§∑ they're busy trying to stay up to date with what's happening in the technology world they don't spend as much time reading political news
Concerned more with themselves
The time requirement for CPR E is very high. Thus making it hard to find time to keep up with current political facts important to informed voting. 
I don‚Äôt know.
Stem majors are busy and don't study public issues as much as other majors
They are not interested in politics
They more focused on schoolwork and don't want to spend the time or effort to explore voting and/or candidates.
Most STEM people don't think about social issues much in my experience
STEM majors experience less political influences in day to day life than those in other majors.
I think we get distracted by the intensity of our degree programs and forget about the real world
Student stress, too stuck up on problems, disinterest
Perhaps we are more apathetic and cynical than other majors. We see our beliefs either not represented or represented by those we cannot trust(ex. career politictians). There are also plenty of things that never change regardless of what political party is in power(ex. foreign policy).
They aren't engaged with community
They are too busy to think about politics. 
We're super overworked. It's difficult to look up from all the work youre buried in enough to even take care of yourself and maintain a social life let alone be informed enough to vote. Not much matters outside of your next project.
Unfortunately, Engineering majors that I've talked to have been more apathetic about elections. They know they have a job and don't care as much about others.
They don't care. Most of the STEM majors are the ones benefitting from the way things are currently so they do not see that anything needs to change/they don't care about social issues because it doesn't effect them
We aren‚Äôt concerned about job security
No clue

Too busy 
They think they are too busy to vote
Most don‚Äôt care for either candidate and don‚Äôt care if either win 
They don‚Äôt leave their rooms. All 4 choices below as well. 
Dont care too much

It is a lot of work to vote if you are not from the state of Iowa. I have no clue on the rates of STEM Majors being form the actual state of Iowa, but it may be higher. 
STEM majors are more busy, and professors may not be engaged with politics in class while other majors may talk about it.
They have too much homework 

Politics do not interest some people
Analytical people, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important
Personally, I feel as if we are not always as educated about political topics as some other people may be


STEM is male dominated and men are less likely to vote than women
Not sure. Higher % of males? Maybe lack of interest in politics/lack of crossover in areas of interest?
Typically disinterested in politics. Feel indifferent about them. 
doesn't seem relevant or like a top priority
Their major isn't as socially involved, such as a major in public relations.
Uninterested or do not see the relevance
STEM majors seem less socially and politically oriented.
Apathy, self-righteous nihilism
We can be ignorant of the outside world.
Focused on other things 
Not as concerned about politics. 
Classes prevent students from taking the time to research candidates and make an educated decision on who to vote for.
Heavier workload
Individual votes don't really seem to matter in the current system.
Because theyre smart and realize our government will suck no matter who we elect.
Don‚Äôt think it would affect the outcome

"Political apathy or ""both sides are bad so why bother"""
STEM majors have no time whatsoever to dedicate to political involvement. They‚Äôre also less likely to make an ill informed decision and throw off the democracy.
Logically they know their vote has a neglagable impact on the outcome.
Lack of interest in politics.

Indifference, thinks that politics don't affect them
I think that STEM majors are primarily focused on school and personal issues opposed to the world of politics around them.


Voting doesn't impact us much. All the politicians are leeches that don't help the country most of the time
Voting seems more of an action taken by other degree s3eking programs, less tech based. This although it is very important for society to vote it is less of a concern then the new science topics
STEM majors don't go out and do things like socialize / have friends / vote
Lack of Knowledge (importance)
laziness
They are less in touch with how they feel about things
Can‚Äôt decide because there‚Äôs no good choice 
many STEM students do not have an interest in politics
Too busy to really look into candidates
They know that statistically their vote is almost worthless
Not a lot of time to vote

They don‚Äôt care
Not focused as much on politics as other majors
Because it doesnt really affect their career and they are among the busiest majors. 
They may not believe it has much importance to them, or they just could not make up their mind, or felt too uninformed. 

They're more focused on things that directly pertain to their research 
They are busying working or don't care about the voting outcome
I feel as if many STEM majors tend not to talk about politics and are not as civically engaged.
Maybe because they are engrossed in their studies?
They might think it doesn‚Äôt matter who gets elected because they will be fine financially no matter what

I'm not sure
Their majors are less politically oriented compared to some of the humanities and social sciences
I think that STEM students don't have time due to coursework to get involved politically. 
STEM majors are politically distant 
Not exposed to the ideas of changing the world without our trade.
Too much class work 
A lack of time perhaps? And many just seem uninterested 
I don't know. Personally, I think democracy is flawed in the aspect that voters are often uneducated. If I was to vote, I would do proper research beforehand. But most of society aren't properly educated about who or what they are voting for. This leads to the most popular side to win and the most popular side won't necessarily be what is in the best interest of the people that voted.
It was situation to who was the lesser evil, so they chose not to vote. Also, they may think that there vote does not matter in turns of being the deciding vote on who is president.

not enough time in the day, forgetfulness
Presidential is electoral college, so it‚Äôs really just a statistics poll. However local gov probs matters more but it‚Äôs not a huge impact
They don't care for it cause it won't affect them directly.
Maybe students with STEM majors, on average, consume less political news and have more interests outside of politics. 

I have no idea
Issues might not be as present in class discussions, etc
Majority of those students are likely white and privileged in a sense that they don‚Äôt feel the need to vote.
I think it is as low as it is because it could be that they are more focused on their studies that they do not think about voting. Another reason might be because people in those majors might not be American citizens therefore cannot vote when elections happen. Another reason could be that people in those majors are focused on other things and do not think that it would matter to vote. Overall, it just depends on the person and the statistics of the majors, but these are just my opinion. 
I think while we are in school STEM majors are told that they need to devote 100% of their time to learning the challenging course work so they believe they don‚Äôt have time to be politically involved or vote 
disillusionment 
They‚Äôre rich and privileged enough that the election results won‚Äôt effect them.
Not as engaged in politics in general 
because people do not realize that voting is important to their profession/major and just their life and STEM majors are not required to take classes that touch on how the government dictates their daily life as much as say a liberal arts major sees it in classes. 

They may care less about politics than their interests inside of STEM, or they may often feel attacked by politics and so they don't want to be apart of it.
Non arts have less focus on societal issues
Political stress and the feeling like their vote doesn't matter.
Many of the people in these majors may come from smaller communities that focus less on encouraging voting and more on general education
They might feel that their vote doesn't matter.
STEM students have a higher workload and are more too busy to find time to vote. 
I believe that students are not motivated enough to get involved in the complex system of politics
My peers have mindsets that are very logical. They may feel that voting does not affect them, so they should not waste their time doing it. Some of them are also probably very uninformed about current events.

The majority of students at ISU are STEM majors (right?) So there will be more people not voting just because there's a large pool of people.

Stem majors don‚Äôt get as much exposure to the problems
I think due to the lack of social sciences required in STEM majors there is less of an understanding of the importance of voting and civic engagement. 
I thin that it is lower because they have less time to devote to researching canadates and decided who to vote for.
They are less engaged in politics. 
They've got other shit to do because stem shit is hard, get off our backs dude
Too busy 
We don‚Äôt care 
Apathy. Personally I don't care who runs the government as long as they don't bother me.
not sure

Nerds just stay in their own bubbles and play video games. They don't care about voting.
Less reliant on government programs
It's easier for students focused on STEM to ignore/forget about the political climate. Other majors are more closely and immediately affected by it.

Most probably just don‚Äôt care
People not caring/knowing how significant the decision is
We have other priorities over becoming further involved in the chaos of modern politics. 
They are Afraid to admit what party they support 
they have no free time
I'm not sure

Too busy 

They're intellectuals




They forget about it.
I feel that STEM majors future careers wont be effected as significantly as others (for example business or education). 
Apathy
Less education on the importance of voter efficacy. Less education on political processes and the importance of being an active voter.
Because of busy lives

Individuals' focus are centered towards their academics rather than an outside stimuli (voting).
Thinking their one vote won‚Äôt matter, no time because of coursework, apathy.
Perhaps they feel less in touch with the social and political world compared to liberal arts students


Maybe they are too busy with their majors they don't find time?

They may not care for it 
I believe that certain personalities/characteristics of STEM students don't view or value democracy the same as those students who are perhaps more socially engaged.

i don't know
They may not feel like it concerns them.
voting may be inconvenient or unattainable to some. Soe may be confused, and others may simply not care to vote.

Disillusioned 
One vote doesn‚Äôt matter 
A lot of us are very lazy
Because the students were busy studying, forgot to vote, or did not care. 
"I think that voting has almost become a method of ""political activism"", and I know that for most of the engineering college, we are trying to stay out of that. I disagree with that view, but that is the feeling that I have gotten from others I have talked to about this. There is also the factor of busyness, and the fact that many engineering students are not in their home town. This sounds like extra work that many feel they don't have time for. "
Because we understand that due to electoral college, individual votes do not matter unless you are in a state that regularly changes. 

I would say that because we think more analytically and both sides had poor choices, it may have been indifferent to us for who won.
Stem majors see less of how the politicians will affect their field and deal with those problems less everyday than other majors
People don‚Äôt seem to understand how important voting is
Don‚Äôt care and are focused on their major
Idk
Too must to worry about politics, trying to get this degree
I believe we have significantly more work to do than other majors and it can be difficult to carve out the time to follow the election and take the time to vote. 

They don‚Äôt find voting to be applicable to their major.

Stem Majors tend to be less politically involved since they tend to be more scientifically/mathematically inclined as opposed to socially inclined. 
Most people either don't have the time because of busy schedules or don't care enough to vote.

Unaffected by result
I believe STEM majors approach problem differently and tend to want to research decisions before they vote. At this point in time, personally, I don‚Äôt really have the time or energy to effectively research all parties involved in a vote. 
We don't care.
Little representation of STEM community members within political positions, and a lack of action based upon scientific data.
I believe low voting rates amongst STEM students are due to common personality types within the major and our interests in general. STEM majors typically don‚Äôt interface with inter workings of the world at large like lib arts, business, and other various majors do. While other majors centrally focus on learning about people and history STEM majors focus on theory and equations. Naturally, the majors dealing with more human focused information are likely more interested in politics than STEM majors due to the role politics have to do within a lib arts or business major‚Äôs field whereas in STEM politics have less of an impact in our studies. 
Stem be hard
We know the facts. The systems full of ignorant people who will say anything to get elected. Politics is a bigger joke than anything else in this country. 

I don‚Äôt pay attention to politics so if I don‚Äôt vote it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have a educated opinion on candidates
I don't know
They dont think it effects them
Generally More Introverted 
They do not have as great of a humanities background.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth their time?
they have enough to worry about without slapping on an election, and doing proper research on the candidates
I think the voting rate is so low because STEM majors typically aren't concerned with a lot of the slandering that goes into politics and it makes it hard to actually know what the candidates are really about when all that the media portrays is the candidates bashing on each other.
Because their interest areas do not overlap as directly with civil issues. They are not as interested in civil issue and more often choose not to engage with them.
The type of people. Maybe busy
STEM majors tend to be more libertarianly inclined and at younger ages probably don‚Äôt care as much about the specifics of who is in charge of the government. At this point in our lives, it makes sense to me that most STEM majors don‚Äôt care a whole lot about the government as long as they don‚Äôt notice it.
STEM majors have more to deal with in terms of academics, clubs, and career development than other majors. STEM majors are also likely not as informed on the political scene and system of today as majors more related to the political sciences.
Less awareness of political process?
Stem majors arnt typically 
Isn‚Äôt the most important thing in their life with limited time.
Not sure

Lack of time 
The intense nature of STEM majors makes us students feel as if we‚Äôre disconnected from the real world at times


Maybe students in STEM majors don't care as much about politics
High paying jobs ahead
Look at voting as not benefical due to big numbers of voters.
Engineer have to much classwork on their plate so voting isn't a priority when compared doing better in a class.

Low interest
I think us more science minded people realize that politicians are just greedy and don‚Äôt care about science, I think this could contribute to that idea. Lack of scientists is a problem in our government 
Very busy schedules
Lack of choice in candidates
Maybe the classes they take focus less on social issues
Most politicians say gibberish to get people to like them and stem majors see through the bullshit.
People are too busy and focused on school that we don‚Äôt have time to research candidates, so we don‚Äôt vote if we don‚Äôt know about the candidates.
We always seem busy
While I will be voting, I personally feel I have more interesting things to attend to, and would rather avoid politics at any cost.
I believe that many in the stem field think that their vote may not affect things in the larger picture. Perhaps politics as a whole is uninteresting to them.
Personally it's because we have little reason to vote. We aren't invested in anything, school prices won't be lowered until I'm done. No real reason to vote.

Voter apathy
From speaking with my peers, most did not put much emphasis on voting, or simply hadn't heard of most of the candidates. Additionally, since many are from states beside Iowa, they will vote absentee or simply don't want to register in Iowa. 
They do not care as much as other majors might
Maybe STEM majors don't prioritize voting that high.
Lack of time, lack of political interest
Busier schedule 
We try to solve black and white issues. The average STEM student may be more likely to be put off by the sheer quantity of noise surrounding US politics.
Anti-socialness among those majors could be the cause of a lack of discussion of politics among the people in those majors leading to less importance and less voted turnout.
they're busy 
STEM majors are more demanding of their students than others, making it difficult for them to make any additional time or effort for politics.
Because they know that because of the electorial college, individual votes dont matter 
Lack of interest
Because many of us are busy with other projects or exams that the election can pass us by without realizing it.
(I think both those numbers are very low) theres many possibilities why this is the case though, for one stem majors tend to have a more time intensive work load in comparison to other majors, we also have a lot more job security than many liberal arts type majors so we might not care so much about the social climate because it wont directly affect us (and lets be real science-y people are cold hearted and lacking in empathy so the chance that we are voting for the greater good over our own interests is low), I think the biggest factor could be that many of us don't take any classes where we talk about opinion, policy, or current events for us it is all facts and analytics all the time so we arent even thinking about varying thoughts on social issues. also the political climate today can be very alienating and all the conflict and argument can really turn someone off to politics regardless of their major 
Because we're busy  
Less concerned about politics than ISU student probably. 
People care more about their classes & don't have time to go vote since STEM majors have plentiful work to complete
We don‚Äôt give a shit about politics. 
Many STEM majors believe they don‚Äôt have enough time for civil duties such as voting, and are more focused on their studies and careers.
Homework/Workload, lack of rational-level discourse in politics(often emotion-based)
--
Too busy and don't have time to study candidates to make an informed decision
Distraction/Forgot
STEM students likely have fuller schedules and more homework to complete, leaving them with less time to go to the polls. 
politics/ethics/morals aren‚Äôt talked about as much in those majors 
Dissillusionment

Low interest
STEM majors are considered more difficult and time consuming than other majors. Perhaps this lack of free time is a factor. However, I also think it may be because STEM classes speak less about the political process than other majors
Stem majors may not be as inclined to be involved or aware of civic activities such as voting. Liberal arts type majors may offer more learning opportunities about the importance of voting and encourage those students to do so. 
A lack of empathy for less-advantaged citizens, a lack of desire to concern oneself with news & politics because it is ‚Äúless important‚Äù than rigorous scientific pursuits, confining oneself to social groups that are like-minded and less active politically, etc. Additionally, a high proportion of white males in STEM contributes to a lower incentive to be civicallly-engaged. White males see no problems with the status-quo with respect to their social standing and quality of life.
Politics is not interesting 
I think they think they are too busy or that it doesn't effect them. That voting and all that stuff is the job of humanities majors. They would never say this, but I think that's part of it.
Preferred candidates are shamed and do not make it far in the election process
Many are unsatisfied with the candidates or don't have compelling political opinions/lack interest
Tend not to be as engaged in social issues as humanities issues, have less contact with politics in class, not as commonly discussed among peers who are also STEM majors
Don‚Äôt have time to go to the polls
Politics is garbage
I'd imagine that social sciences vote the most, so I think that plays a factor in it. 
People may think they‚Äôre too busy
Socialization 


They find themselves to be busy
A lack of connection to main stream media.
They don't take asany political classes and aren't therefore forced to think about these things
We are more busy. We also do not take as many classes that focus on current events. It takes a lot of effort to be informed.
Students are busy and maybe not as passionate about voting

People who're passionate about STEM generally don't hear much about it from candidates on the campaign trail. (besides Yang)
too busy studying to go vote
Most STEM majors don't really think the government has that big of an impact on their lives. Plus they're more introverted and self centered.
We're a little too dedicated to our studies, so we don't have much time to do much else. I know that I haven't been paying close enough attention to what is going on politically right now to choose a candidate that I like.
STEM majors probably see it as something outside of their area of interest as they can see it as not directly relating to their areas of interest but voting has a huge effect on everyone. 
Perhaps the rigor of courses has kept them distracted in regard to our Nation‚Äôs political climate, making them feel as if their voice should have less say as far as voting goes.
Busy. 
Not a clue
Maybe it's because we get so much homework and we don't have time to understand politics for ourselves -- and not what someone is trying to push down our throats-- that we don't feel necessarily competent to vote for anything confidently.
They are too busy working

Not as politically driven
a lot of us are more focused on stem than politics
They may be more concerned about systems of technology, as opposed to systems of people. Additionally, they may not be as concerned about traditions and societal expectations, which may also contribute.
Lack of education/motivation to get educated about voting/our government

No interest in politics; politics is illogical (based on opinion or emotion) but STEM is built on logic (based on facts and truths).
Not a lot of time to register and go
Politics don‚Äôt matter to STEM majors, we just want to get a good job, make money, and die. No matter the current economy there will always be a need for us. 
"When discussing voting with peers, many claimed they were ""too busy"" to keep up with politics of go to the polling station. I thought it was a dumb excuse. "
Most of STEM people are quiet nerds. Ames is full of loud, far-left people that we could give 2 shits about.
Because STEM majors are more likely to be adapt to their current situations and do not feel compelled to change their environment but instead themselves.
Maybe their major is just more disconnected from the political scene than others? I'm not too sure why.
Because STEM majors have their concerns elsewhere.
I think that STEM is relatively unaffected by politics because I think that most politicians agree on needing to continue support for STEM related research and development. I think this leads to STEM majors not voting since they just don‚Äôt really care nor are affected by who wins the election
No one cares enough
Busy
they are harder majors? too much work to do and think they don‚Äôt have time to vote?
Buncha nerds
Introverts. Com S majors can barely get out of their room and take a shower let alone vote.
I think it's this way because these students generally think they will not make a difference.
Isn‚Äôt this what you‚Äôre supposed to figure out
working on other things, so it is not a priority
I would think that it is because their majors are less involved in politically charged fields. Also, on a personal note, it is very hard to take charge and be politically active while pursuing a hard major simply because of time constraints and stress.
The nature of the degrees doesn't not lend itself toward concern about political issues. Additionally, STEM majors tend to have less time to do non-course work. 

I think that compared to the ideas that STEM majors focus on, electing a president is not as high a priority.
Politics are often illogical, which is stressful and tiring.
Rigorous Course-load 

They don't care enough about politics to go out and vote.
STEM majors are more preoccupied with coursework than most other students.
Because they have so much school work that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave time to worry about it‚Äù and they are so focused on school, getting an internship, and side projects so they can get a good job when they finish college. 

We‚Äôre busy people
Because they're smart enough to understand how useless, corrupt, and broken our political system is.
STEM majors understand that voting is futile because the system is easily gamed and every candidate is a just different flavor of clown. Elections and votes are largely insignificant, no matter the demographic, because no good people are corrupt or profitable enough to get corporate investors.
Engineering majors tend to think more along their lines of work, and voting usually doesn't affect that
They pay less attention to politics than other majors because the outcomes will probably have a relatively low effect on them
People in the engineering department are introverted and don't follow politics because they talking to people about and they think that politics doesn't effect their lives
Their future careers won't be influenced by politics as much as other majors.
Because they believe statistically their vote doesn't matter
Don't care
STEM majors are busy and may notice that they're individual votes will not significantly impact the election
Individuals in these majors may look at how many people vote and decide that their individual votes don't matter
Idk
